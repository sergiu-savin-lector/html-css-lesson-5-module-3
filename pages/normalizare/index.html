    <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

    <p>
      This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length
      to it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing
      the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for
      various other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser
      displays various HTML elements by default. It can also be useful when
      testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some
      elements can go wrong then.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that the set of
      elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected those
      elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules, in
      my opionion.
    </p>
    <div>
      This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements
      instead of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of
      <code>div</code>.)
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a block quotation containing a single paragraph. Well, not
        quite, since this is not <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you
        understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup
        very normally anyway.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following contains address information about the author, in an
      <code>address</code> element.
    </p>
    <address>
      <a href="../personal.html" lang="fi" hreflang="en">Jukka Korpela</a>,

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list
      (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list
      before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't
      guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list
      header".
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for
        short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas
        for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing
        between items.
      </li>

      <li>
        Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list
        now without making any more fuss about it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following is a <code>menu</code> list:</p>
    <menu>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
        probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
      </li>
    </menu>

    <p>The following is a <code>dir</code> list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
        probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
      </li>
